DESCRIPTION OF APP:
Purpose:
The purpose of this kahoot-esque app is to allow users to either take a quiz or create
a quiz for others to take, as well as have the ability to save highscores

Functionality:
The App starts my prompting you to login or create a user, the app then pulls
a list of available quiz's to take or give you an option to create a quiz and assign
it to a specific user or allow everyone to take it.

Future Enhancements: 
docs/Screenshots/Future enhancements evidence
Given enough time, some future enhancements we would like to make would include;
 
a way for the community to upload and download quiz's they have made through
the app and a leaderboard for each quiz.

Colourizing the display

various accessability enhancements like browser compatibility/text to speech/mouse compatability

creating a randomizer for the questions, answers and answer locations to improve replay 
value(to hinder cheating by replaying quiz until perfect score)
possibly creating a daily(maybe?) limit for each quiz.

Discussions:
Societal,legal, ethical Impact: The functionality of the app itself would have no impact on anyone of any specific gender/race ect but through the use 
of the create quiz method it is possible for someone to make statements with unobjective answers that would offend people. Adding ways to
weed out these potentially offensive questions/answers would be too big a task to warrant the app still being useful and the restrictions would cause
issues with people claiming free speech. Adding a disclaimer would possible help with any Legal issues but that would be the extent of 
possible solutions to any anti societal aspects of this app

Accessability: Having more time to work on this we would make it a web application so that people can access it from browsers without needing
certain applications, gems ect installed. Extending on this we would also make it usable with a mouse so that people with difficulty using a keyboard
would find it easier to use this app. we would also add text to speech to allow sight impaired people to hear the printed text as well.
The app is currently only available in english but adding multiple languages as a future enhancement would also help to increase the accessability
